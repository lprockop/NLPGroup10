300,Abortion Rewrites,A draft of the Democratic platform on abortion is parsed.,"Pro-life liberals and the Democratic platform: Steven Waldman, the editor-in-chief of Beliefnet, is disappointed by the abortion plank in the draft Democratic platform.  ""The key linguistic debate has been whether to 'reduce the number of abortions' or 'reduce the need for abortions,'"" Waldman writes on his Beliefnet blog. ""Pro-life folks favored the former. Pro-choice folks favored the latter. The pro-choice folks won. In fact, the 2004 platform said abortion 'should be safe, legal and rare' — language [that] casts abortion reduction as morally preferable, something this platform does not.""   While the draft platform ""includes — for the first time — language specifically designed to reduce the need for abortions,"" Waldman says that religious Democrats wanted it to go further, with ""moral language casting abortion as a morally inferior choice."" He concludes:    All in all, I'd say that this platform does NOT do what was necessary to win substantial numbers of Catholics or moderate evangelicals. However, in combination with a strong personal statement from Obama about the moral necessity of reducing abortion, the party could make real headway. All eyes now turn to Obama's performance at Saddleback Church later this week.     Daniel Schultz of Street Prophets, an online forum for religious liberals, agrees with Waldman's take. ""Gone is the Clinton-era 'safe, legal and rare' moralism, replaced with some rather vague wording about 'abortion reduction,'"" Schultz writes, using his Street Prophets handle, ""pastordan.""   Schultz points out that Dana Goldstein of The American Prospect interprets the new abortion plank ""as a victory for feminist pro-choicers, not pro-lifers."" In a post a Tapped, the Prospect's group blog, Goldstein calls the platform ""a significant victory for reproductive rights advocates.""   ""The Clintonian formula of 'safe, legal, and rare' has been scrubbed,"" Goldstein writes, and the plank isn't ""a modification of the party's pro-choice stance. Rather, it's a strengthening of that position and a re-articulation of the commitment to helping low-income expectant mothers.""

361,The Paragraph on Abortion,"  Following is the text of Paragraph 8.25, which was adopted today by delegates preparing the proposed final document of the United Nations Conference on Population and Development:   In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. All governments and relevant intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations are urged to strengthen their commitment to women's health, to deal with the health impact of unsafe abortion* as a major public health concern and to reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded improved family planning services. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counseling. Any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process. In circumstances in which abortion is not against the law, such abortion should be safe. In all cases, women should have access to quality services for the management of complications arising from abortion. Post-abortion counseling, education and family-planning services should be offered promptly which  [ would ]  also help to avoid repeat abortions.","Following is the text of Paragraph 8.25, which was adopted today by delegates preparing the proposed final document of the United Nations Conference on Population and Development:",1994-09-10T05:00:00+0000,1994,0.06607842595011393,0.09666131971383286,0.07048635317233104,0.09572532792595609,0.08005737879090567,-0.1240169416386083,-0.04648394496035628,0.038114501806835094,0.07897364121510672,-0.03768483851025517,1.5,0.00019824419745006924,0.006247725842085348

475,Palin on Abortion and Gays,The Republican vice-presidential nominee walks a bit of a fuzzy line on abortion due to rape or incest.,"Gov. Sarah Palin's views on abortion are pretty well known. She's opposed, pretty much across the board. And the entire right-leaning side of the world heralded her and her husband's decision to go forward with a pregnancy, at 44, that resulted in the April birth of Trig, who has Down syndrome. She barely talks about her infant, except to say that she understands special needs children because of Trig.   And given that Governor Palin announced at the beginning of the Republican National Convention that her 17-year-old daughter Bristol is pregnant and will have the child and marry the father, it raises questions about a woman's choice -- young or old. Those decisions somehow just hold sway, with women of all party stripes, and none in particular.   In interviews with CBS News' Katie Couric, (again), Governor Palin walked a bit of a fuzzy line on the issues of a woman impregnated due to rape or incest. And it seems, from this interview, that Governor Palin would be hesitant to impose criminal charges against someone who had an abortion under such difficult circumstances:   Ms. Couric: If a 15-year-old is raped by her father, do you believe it should be illegal for her to get an abortion, and why?  Ms. Palin: I am pro-life. And I'm unapologetic in my position that I am pro-life. And I understand there are good people on both sides of the abortion debate. In fact, good people in my own family have differing views on abortion, and when it should be allowed. Do I respect people's opinions on this? Now, I would counsel to choose life. I would also like to see a culture of life in this country. But I would also like to take it one step further. Not just saying I am pro-life and I want fewer and fewer abortions in this country, but I want them, those women who find themselves in circumstances that are absolutely less than ideal, for them to be supported, and adoptions made easier.  Ms. Couric: But ideally, you think it should be illegal for a girl who was raped or the victim of incest to get an abortion?  Ms. Palin: I'm saying that, personally, I would counsel the person to choose life, despite horrific, horrific circumstances that this person would find themselves in. And, um, if you're asking, though, kind of foundationally here, should anyone end up in jail for having an … abortion, absolutely not. That's nothing I would ever support.  Ms. Couric: Some people have credited the morning-after pill for decreasing the number of abortions. How do you feel about the morning-after pill?  Ms. Palin: Well, I am all for contraception. And I am all for preventative measures that are legal and safe, and should be taken, but Katie, again, I am one to believe that life starts at the moment of conception. And I would like to see …  Ms. Couric: And so you don't believe in the morning-after pill?  Ms. Palin: ... I would like to see fewer and fewer abortions in this world. And again, I haven't spoken with anyone who disagrees with my position on that.  Ms. Couric: I'm sorry, I just want to ask you again. Do you not support or do you condone or condemn the morning-after pill?  Ms. Palin: Personally, and this isn't McCain-Palin policy …  Ms. Couric: No, that's OK, I'm just asking you.  Ms. Palin: But personally, I would not choose to participate in that kind of contraception.    As for evolution, and how it should be taught, Ms. Palin says:   ""Oh, I think it should be taught as an accepted principle. And, as you know, I say that also as the daughter of a school teacher, a science teacher, who has really instilled in me a respect for science. It should be taught in our schools. And I won't deny that I see the hand of God in this beautiful creation that is Earth. But that is not part of the state policy or a local curriculum in a school district. Science should be taught, in science class.""    And on gays, Governor Palin said: ""But what you're talking about, I think, value here, what my position is on homosexuality and you can pray it away, because I think that was the title that was listed on that bulletin. And you know, I don't know what prayers are worthy of being prayed. I don't know what prayers are going to be asked and answered. But as for homosexuality, I am not going to judge Americans and the decisions that they make in their adult personal relationships. I have one of my absolute best friends for the last 30 years happens to be gay, and I love her dearly. And she is not my ""gay friend,"" she is one of my best friends, who happens to have made a choice that isn't a choice I would have made. But I am not going to judge people.""  One little postscript: It's been pretty apparent throughout this last week that Ms. Couric has managed to elicit, through quite interesting questions, what Ms. Palin believes. Like no other journalist before the debate on Thursday night.

482,Walking the Abortion Plank,"Democrats may be reaching out to opponents of Roe v. Wade, but their support of that historic decision remains unshakable.","""Are Democrats Now Pro-Life?"" asked ABC News this week, in an online story that pretty much summed up the buzz surrounding the party's new official platform.   This year's language on abortion, adopted last weekend, speaks of how ""health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions."" It declares, ""The Democratic Party also strongly supports a woman's decision to have a child,"" and was spun all week as an olive branch to evangelicals, a significant departure from past policy, and a victory for the opponents of abortion rights.  ""They reached out to us,"" said Jim Wallis, a progressive evangelical leader who was consulted on the abortion language, and who on Tuesday convoked a rather remarkable phone press conference in which a group of Republicans, Catholics and evangelicals came together to publicize and promote the new Democratic statement.   ""The committee worked hard to give language that gave evangelicals and Roman Catholics the sense that they could participate in the Democratic Party without the compromise of their convictions,"" Tony Campolo, a prominent evangelical, and a member of the Democratic platform committee, said in the conference call.  Joel Hunter, senior pastor of the Northland Church in Orlando, Fla., and a former head of the Christian Coalition, went even further. ""Pro-lifers of both parties can now support Senator Obama,"" he said.   A lot of anti-abortion activists — including the leadership of the group Democrats for Life, which has long tried to get their party to soften its stand on reproductive rights – weren't buying it. ""It would be really tragic if some young evangelicals unaware of history of civics would vote for a candidate that will guarantee that we will have abortion on demand for another 30 years,"" Gary Bauer, president of American Values, told Bloomberg News.   And they were right. There is nothing new in the Democratic position. The abortion plank's first sentence, ""The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay, and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right,"" is, arguably, the most powerful statement in favor of abortion rights that the party has ever made. Some pro-choice activists find it less grating to the ear than the old Clintonian formulation, which promised in the 2004 party platform to make abortion ""safe, legal, and rare.""  Proposing to aid women in becoming mothers by ""ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre- and post-natal health care, parenting skills, income support, and caring adoption programs,"" as the platform does, hardly amounts to a radical departure. Adoption was mentioned in 2004, and Democratic legislation aimed at abortion prevention and reduction — Hillary Clinton's Prevention First Act and Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Tim Ryan's Reducing the Need for Abortion Initiative — has long been circulating in Congress. Barack Obama himself has been talking about the dual approach for years.  And pro-choice opinion leaders like Planned Parenthood and NARAL have been talking about the importance of reducing the number of abortions in America for decades. ""For the past 20 years leaders on reproductive rights have always established that a woman's right to decide is fundamental, but as a nation we can make it more possible for women to not have to face the decision in the first place,"" former NARAL president Kate Michelman, who has advised the Obama campaign on abortion rights issues, told me in phone interview yesterday. ""Those are not contradictory goals. And this is not compromise.""  If there is any sort of olive branch on offer to the anti-abortion community right now, it seems to me to consist chiefly of this week's spin campaign, which gave cover to evangelicals and Catholics who have come out as pro-Obama (or as willing to talk to Obama) and now may well need to save face.   There may be something more going on here as well, as was suggested this week by Douglas Kmiec, professor of constitutional law at Pepperdine University, and a former Reagan Administration lawyer who once wrote briefs requesting that the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade and now supports Barack Obama.  ""We've been trying to find the elusive fifth vote on the Supreme Court for over 30 years,"" he said during Tuesday's press conference. ""We have not found it and even if we did find it, overturning Roe will not save a single life but instead merely return the question to the states."" The Democratic platform, however, ""recognizes that there is more than one way, alternative ways, to discourage abortion,"" he continued. ""While it still falls short of the Catholic ideal … we live in this world and we pursue the art of the possible.""  The truth is — as both sides of the abortion divide now know, and Kmiec acknowledged — Roe itself barely matters anymore. It is dying a death by a thousand cuts as state regulations, harassment of providers and other methods of psychological warfare erode women's ability to access abortion services in many parts of the country.  The great frustration of the abortion opponents who hoped to gain ground with the Democrats this campaign season is that the new plank does not provide additional ammunition for that deeply wounding form of war. ""What we are waiting to hear from Barack Obama,"" Campolo said on Tuesday, ""is that he … sees this as a moral issue and an issue of conscience.""   Let's hope Obama doesn't take the bait. Or better yet: let's hope that, as he seeks out new religious allies (the problematic Jeremiah Wright becoming a much more distant memory), he pushes hard to redefine the moral high ground in the abortion rights debate. Sanctifying life – without care for the living — is little more than a morality play.   Supporting families is a moral choice.

Planned Parenthood Arizona and Tucson Women’s Center asked the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Tuesday to block the law, which requires doctors to follow protocols approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. The original F.D.A. rules limited so-called medication abortions to the first seven weeks of pregnancy and called for high doses of one of the drugs. Most clinics now use methods backed by major medical groups as safer, using smaller doses through the first nine weeks of pregnancy. Opponents say the law makes medication abortion harder to get. On Monday, Judge David C. Bury of United States District Court denied the groups’ request for a temporary restraining order.

673,A Threat to Abortion Rights,"  President Clinton is on the verge of doing a grave disservice to American women by betraying his campaign promise to defend abortion rights. Mr. Clinton pledged to appoint Supreme Court justices who accept a woman's right to an abortion. But according to Neil A. Lewis of The Times, the White House and Justice Department have decided not to rule out every candidate for the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals solely because they have expressed anti-abortion views.   For this Administration to install Federal judges who have publicly opposed abortion rights would be a political sellout of incalculable dimensions. The new policy rests on the goofy notion that the lower courts are less crucial than the Supreme Court in the legal battle for women's liberty. In fact, those lower courts are the front lines of that battle and, for many women, the final decision-maker.","President Clinton is on the verge of doing a grave disservice to American women by betraying his campaign promise to defend abortion rights.

674,The Abortion Tide Turns,"  With a few strokes of a pen yesterday, President Clinton discarded five Federal policies that both traduced tolerance and infringed freedom. By doing so, he gave his new Administration a wise and humane start.   On the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Mr. Clinton suspended the ""gag rule,"" a relic of the Bush Administration that forbade anyone but a physician to give abortion counseling and referrals at federally funded family planning clinics, supposedly pending new regulations. From now on, poor, pregnant women who must rely on clinics for their medical care are assured of a privilege taken for granted by the more affluent.","With a few strokes of a pen yesterday, President Clinton discarded five Federal policies that both traduced tolerance and infringed freedom.

676,Abortion: Where Are the Doctors?,"  On March 10, 1993, a physician named David Gunn was killed in Pensacola, Fla., by an anti-abortion activist. Dr. Gunn had divided his time among six abortion clinics in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. On July 29, 1994, Dr. John B. Britton was also killed by an anti-abortion activist. Dr. Britton regularly flew from his home elsewhere in Florida to work at Pensacola's only other abortion clinic.    The physician who reportedly succeeded Dr. Britton, Steven Chase Brigham, is equally peripatetic. In the last two years his medical license was suspended in New York and Georgia and restricted in New Jersey and California amid accusations of improper procedures. Anyone looking for proof of the shortage of abortion providers in the United States has only to look to Dr. Gunn's 1,000-mile-a-week marathons, Dr. Britton's cross-state commuting and Dr. Brigham's record. The murders of Dr. Gunn and Dr. Britton are stark proof that the small number of people still performing abortions are working in a war zone.","On March 10, 1993, a physician named David Gunn was killed in Pensacola, Fla., by an anti-abortion activist.

691,The Hospitals Abdicate on Abortions,"  It is all very well that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has voted unanimously to require prospective obstetricians and the hospitals that teach them to include abortion training in their programs, unless they have moral objections. But how do teaching hospitals train obstetricians in a procedure that not many hospitals -- in some states, no hospitals -- any longer do? Fear of harassment and reluctance to alienate prospective donors have driven the hospitals to run for cover.   In New York City, where only 9 percent of abortions in 1993 were performed in hospitals, Planned Parenthood has taken up the slack by training residents in six programs, among them Columbia-Presbyterian's. It has also taken up the financial burden of doing so. A noble undertaking, but isn't there something perverse about Planned Parenthood having to do (with its own money, besides) what a medical school should have been doing all along?","It is all very well that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has voted unanimously to require prospective obstetricians and the hospitals that teach them to include abortion training in their programs, unless they have moral objections.

787,Decision Time on Abortion,"Today the Supreme Court is expected to announce whether it will consider the future of Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that recognized women's fundamental constitutional right to choose whether to bear a child. 

At issue is the Court's willingness to hear an appeal of a Circuit Court ruling that in October upheld most of Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law, which the American Civil Liberties Union and other pro-choice organizations believe is a direct assault on Roe v. Wade. It is in the nation's best interest for the Court to hear this appeal as soon as possible: we need to know if Roe v. Wade is still the law of the land.

On behalf of the women and clinics who are our clients, we have asked for a review of Pennsylvania's law, which requires parental consent before women under 18 can get an abortion and mandatory 24-hour delays after state-designed lectures to discourage women from seeking an abortion.

If the Court upholds Roe v. Wade and rejects the law, reproductive rights will be secured. If the Court -- packed by President Bush with Justices hostile to abortion rights -- accepts the restrictions as constitutional, advocates of privacy and liberty must seek alternative redress through Congressional action, either by statute or, if necessary, by a constitutional amendment.

If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade -- a move it appears poised to make -- we will lose a decision that Justice Harry A. Blackmun hailed as ""a landmark of liberty,"" and women will lose a right that is essential to full and equal citizenship. Safe, legal abortions have allowed millions to escape the illegal abortions and forced pregnancies that threatened the lives and health of countless women before them.

The right to choose an abortion is not the only thing hanging in the balance. In the last two years, we have seen not only government measures that impede access to abortion but also assaults on other aspects of a woman's right to control her reproductive destiny.

These include limits on the use of contraceptives such as intrauterine devices in Louisiana, a judge forcing women accused of child abuse to use contraception in California, forced Caesarean sections in many states, and President Bush's order that women at federally financed family planning clinics may not receive complete medical information about reproductive options including abortion.

838,The Best Alternative to Abortion,"  ""The prevalence of abortion on demand in America calls into question our respect for the fundamental right to life,"" President Bush said on declaring next Sunday ""National Sanctity of Human Life Day."" Perhaps. But it calls even more into question this country's commitment to making safe, effective birth control accessible to all Americans.   Of 19 Western democracies studied in 1988, only two had a higher pregnancy rate than that of the United States. Only one had a higher abortion rate. At least half the 1.6 million American women who choose abortion each year are victims of contraceptive failure.   That failure rate may soon be cut by Norplant, the first major new contraceptive introduced in this country in 25 years. The rate would be cut even further if Americans could readily obtain injectable contraceptives and low-dosage pills and I.U.D.'s used all over the world. But lawsuits and politics have shrunk the number of pharmaceutical companies doing contraceptive research, from 17 to 1.   There's another reason for America's backwardness about birth control: a reluctance to deal honestly with human sexuality. A 1989 report from the Alan Guttmacher Institute disclosed that sex education instructors were more apt to teach about AIDS and protection from other sexually transmitted diseases than about birth control. No wonder 43 percent of all young American women become pregnant before the age of 20.   In delivering his abortion message, President Bush spoke of the ""loving alternative"" of adoption. But there's a better alternative -- an end to unintended pregnancies.","""The prevalence of abortion on demand in America calls into question our respect for the fundamental right to life,"" President Bush said on declaring next Sunday ""National Sanctity of Human Life Day.""

If abortion became a crime in the United States, she wrote, those attempting to enforce such a law would have only two choices: “Hold women accountable for a criminal act by sending them to prison, or refuse to criminalize the act in the first place.

In an article on Thursday in The Yale Daily News, the student, Aliza Shvarts, was quoted as saying she had inseminated herself “as often as possible” while taking herbal drugs to induce miscarriages as her senior year performance art piece. Her account found its way to the Internet and news outlets before Yale said it had investigated and found it to be false. “The entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed to draw attention to the ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman’s body,” said Helaine Klasky, a university spokeswoman. Ms. Klasky said that when confronted by three Yale officials, Ms. Shvarts acknowledged that she had never been pregnant and did not induce abortions. On Friday, however, Ms. Shvarts had insisted that she had really experienced “repeated, self-induced miscarriages,” although she had said that she had never known if she was actually pregnant. Ms. Klasky responded that the university had expected her to maintain her story: “She said if Yale puts out a statement saying she did not do this, she would say Yale was doing that to protect its reputation.” In Friday’s Yale Daily News, Ms. Shvarts said she planned to display a work that consisted of a cube lined with plastic sheets, with a mixture of blood and petroleum jelly in between, onto which she would project video footage of herself “experiencing miscarriages in her bathroom tub.” Andrew Mangino, the editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said the newspaper had published the article after receiving a news release about the project.

1025,Illinois: Group Sues to Enforce Abortion Notice,The Thomas More Society Pro-Life Law Center filed a lawsuit asking the state’s Supreme Court to order the immediate enforcement of a law passed in 1995 that requires doctors to give at least 48 hours’ notice to an adult family member when a girl under 18 seeks an abortion.,"The Thomas More Society Pro-Life Law Center filed a lawsuit asking the state’s Supreme Court to order the immediate enforcement of a law passed in 1995 that requires doctors to give at least 48 hours’ notice to an adult family member when a girl under 18 seeks an abortion. Enforcement was delayed by state and federal lawsuits challenging the law. A federal appeals court in July ruled the law constitutional and set a date of Aug. 5 for it to take effect. But the state’s Department of Financial and Professional Regulation granted a request for a 90-day moratorium. The Illinois Medical Disciplinary Board, which is responsible for the law’s enforcement, asked for the moratorium to allow medical staffs to become familiar with the law. But the law center’s president, Tom Brejcha, said in a news release that “physicians who perform abortions in Illinois have had 14 years to ‘get ready’ and ‘gear up’ to implement the law.” A spokeswoman for the state attorney general said she could not comment on the case.

1043,West Virginia: Governor Weighs Abortion Bill,"Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was concerned about the constitutionality of a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the State Legislature passed over the weekend.","Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was concerned about the constitutionality of a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which the State Legislature passed over the weekend. Twelve states have passed similar bans, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But West Virginia will be the first with a Democratic governor and Democratic-controlled legislature to embrace the 20-week limit if the governor signs the bill. Supporters contend a fetus that age can feel pain, although the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is no scientific evidence for that view. The Supreme Court in January refused to hear an appeal of a lower court’s decision to strike down an Arizona law banning most abortions after 20 weeks. In Roe v. Wade in 1973, the high court said women have a right to an abortion until the point of fetal viability, generally seen as 24 weeks. “The abortion bill obviously is one that causes me some concern because even the legislative attorneys and others said they feel this bill is unconstitutional,” Governor Tomblin said in a statement.

Does she differ in some significant way from the first-time abortion patient? Is she more irresponsible about obtaining and properly using birth control?    According to Dr. Charlene Berger of Montreal, whose findings on the subject were recently published in ''Family Planning Perspectives,'' the professional journal of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, those questions reflect the stereotypes commonly accepted about multiple-abortion patients.   ''There is a common misbelief among health-care personnel, doctors and the general public that there is something psychologically wrong with women who have more than one abortion,'' said Dr. Berger, director of psychosocial research in family planning at Montreal General Hospital's department of obstetrics and gynecology. ''They have been described as 'neurotic,' 'sick' and 'morally deficient.' ''",What are the psychological effects of repeated abortions on the woman who undergoes them?

At times one woman would inflict these well-meant injuries on a sister, a neighbor; sometimes they were solitary acts of desperation.''   To prevent them, Dr. James went from one neighborhood to another performing abortions. He had performed 13 for Kate Simons's mother, who also gave birth to three children. Those, of course, were the bad old days before family planning clinics and prescription contraceptives, and before the Supreme Court made abortion legal in 1973.","''He dedicated himself to poor immigrant women,'' Kate Simons writes of a Dr. James in ''Bronx Primitive,'' her autobiography, ''for whom there was no sex information, no birth-control clinics, nothing but knitting needles, hot pins, lengths of wire, the drinking of noxious mixtures while they sat in scalding baths to prevent the birth of yet another child.

1159,Mr. Dole Bends on Abortion,"If there was any central theme in Bob Dole's affectionate farewell to his Senate colleagues yesterday, it was that good things simply do not happen in the legislative arena unless people of differing doctrines agree to split their differences. That is precisely what Citizen Dole is now telling his party's right wing. Good things will not happen in November unless they are prepared to compromise on abortion, the most divisive issue facing his party and Presidential campaign.   The candidate's latest pronouncements on abortion were, as usual, attended by confusion. Last week Mr. Dole said he would not ''seek or accept'' a retreat from the current G.O.P. platform, which condemns abortion and demands a ''Human Life Amendment'' to the Constitution. But he also said he wanted the platform to include ''a declaration of tolerance for divergent points of view'' on issues like abortion. His aides said the declaration would be tucked harmlessly in the platform's preamble, where it would amount to a broad plea for tolerance on all issues, and not tied to the abortion plank. That seemed to satisfy rigid pro-lifers like Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan.","If there was any central theme in Bob Dole's affectionate farewell to his Senate colleagues yesterday, it was that good things simply do not happen in the legislative arena unless people of differing doctrines agree to split their differences.

However, the regulation, as contained in the state's Public Health Code, will not be adjusted until the Court's opinion is ''thoroughly analyzed and digested,'' said Richard Lynch, a lawyer in charge of the health unit of the Attorney General's office.

He said that any redrafting of the regulation would involve the Department of Health Services, which would then forward the regulation to the legislature's Regulations Review Committee. The matter would likely not require full General Assembly action, he said, because it is not a state statute.","ARECENT Supreme Court decision that struck down a number of state restrictions on access to abortion made Connecticut's regulation calling for hospitalization for all abortions to be performed after the first three months of pregnancy ''immediately unconstitutional and unenforceable,'' according to Elliot F.
